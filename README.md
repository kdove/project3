## 🚀 Deployment

This application is delployed at [Circa](https://eattburgerapp.herokuapp.com/)


## 📕 User Story

```
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
```

## 💼 Business Context

```
A consumer will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.
```

## ⬇️️ Installation

This setup allows for a Node/Express/React app which can be easily deployed to Heroku.

The front-end React app will auto-reload as it's updated via webpack dev server, and the backend Express app will auto-reload independently with nodemon.

## Getting Started

### **Step 1**

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

***This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.***

### **Step 2**

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.
